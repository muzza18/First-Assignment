2. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO GAIN FROM THIS ASSOCIATION?
    By applying these programing languages and other bioinfotmatics tools, the interaction between an available biomolecules and newly found biomolecules 
    in order to predict more detailed informations about the defects/mutations in the sequence.
